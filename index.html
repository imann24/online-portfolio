                         Hi, welcome to my portfolio! I recently gradudated <a target = "blank" href = "https://www.hampshire.edu/">Hampshire College</a> with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Game Development. I'm currently working as a <a target = "blank" href = "https://www.amazon.jobs/en/job_categories/software-development?base_query=&loc_query=&job_count=10&result_limit=10&sort=relevant&category%5B%5D=software-development&cache">Software Development Engineer at Amazon</a>.

                    <p>
                         I've built an array of <a href = "projects">mobile games</a> in the <a target = "blank" href ="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> engine. I co-founded a game development studio at Hampshire, <a target = "blank" href ="http://glowlime.com/">GlowLime Games</a>. I've worked and interned in a variety of software development settings.

                         I'm passionate about writing clean, flexible systems. I'm dedicated to software engineering as a craft. Whether creating games, applications, or websites, I endeavor to maintain the highest standards of code quality.
