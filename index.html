                         Hi, welcome to my portfolio! I recently gradudated <a target = "blank" href = "https://www.hampshire.edu/">Hampshire College</a> with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Game Development. I've worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a href = "https://www.truex.com/">true[X]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I've built an array of <a href = "projects">mobile games</a> in the <a target = "blank" href ="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> engine. I co-founded a game development studio at Hampshire, <a target = "blank" href ="http://glowlime.com/">GlowLime Games</a>. I've worked and interned in a variety of software development settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I'm passionate about writing clean, flexible systems. I'm dedicated to software engineering as a craft. Whether creating games, applications, or websites, I endeavor to maintain the highest standards of code quality.
